# HALO - Hand-Assisted Learning Operator

A low-cost, sensor-based dataglove and 3D simulation for visualising hand motion in real time.

## Overview

HALO is a prototype dataglove that tracks hand motion using embedded sensors and visualises it in a 3D environment.
It was designed as a proof-of-concept to explore accessible motion tracking without relying on cameras or expensive commercial gloves.

## How It Works

HALO has three main layers:

Hardware - A glove fitted with multiple IMUs (motion sensors) and an ESP32 microcontroller.

Transmission - Sensor data is streamed via I²C and serial to a computer.

Simulation - A 3D model (built in VPython) mirrors the hand’s motion in real time.

It started as a web-based Three.js visualiser, then pivoted to VPython for faster debugging and calibration.

## Hardware Summary

11 IMUs total

2× MPU6050 (6-axis) per finger

1× BNO055 (9-axis) on the wrist

ESP32 microcontroller

2× TCA9548A I²C multiplexers (to handle address conflicts)

3D-printed sensor mounts designed in SolidWorks


## Software Stack
Purpose	Tools / Libraries
Microcontroller	Arduino IDE, Wire, MPU6050, Adafruit_BNO055
Simulation	Python, VPython
Modeling	Blender (hand model), SolidWorks (sensor mounts)
IDEs	Visual Studio Code, Arduino IDE
## Data Processing

To make IMU data usable:

Raw sensor data → Low-pass + Complementary filtering

Orientation represented as quaternions (for stable 3D rotation)

Real-time updates rendered in VPython

## Power Notes

Powering 11 sensors on one glove isn’t trivial.
We tested 9 V and Li-ion batteries with LM2596 buck converters, but ultimately powered the prototype via USB for reliability.
A proper power management PCB is recommended for future versions.

## Future Ideas

Gesture recognition with machine learning

Haptic feedback integration

Modular PCB design

Additional sensors (tactile, ultrasonic, IR)
